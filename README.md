# 🎮 Cell Duel

🦠 1-dimensional cellular automata based game.

Dabbling with cellular automata has been floating around in my head for a while. Then I discovered [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/).

Seemed like a good opportunity to tick two things off my list, and Cell Duel was born.

## ⚠️ Note:

This is a hobby project not intended for public consumption. As such, the code will be jank, the UI will be jank, and pretty much everything else will be jank, too. I don't have a goal other than to have fun, so I'm not going to worry about any of that.
